## Synopsis

“Why does no one remember my world?”

The era when the five great races were competing for hegemony ended with the victory of mankind led by the hero Sid.
However, that world was suddenly “overwritten” in front of a boy named Kai.
In the rewritten world Kai could see a result of mankind's defeat in great war due to absence of their hero Sid.
Now dragons and demons were dominating world, and Kai has been forgotten by all of mankind.
However, upon meeting the mysterious girl Rinne, Kai resolves to destroy the overwritten fate.
In a world without the hero, he inherits Sid's sword and martial arts, in order to challenge the mighty enemies of various races who reign supreme.

## About TL

Well, I'm not really professional linguist so my English is at best on par with school level.
The same with my japanese.

There is also problem with author's style.
Some things sound weird even in japanese for me, so I try to re-phrase it.
Not to mention often it is not clear if narration is from first person perspective or not.
I usually prefer third person perspective, but sometimes author leaves no choice to use first person perspective.
Because of that there might be inconsistency narration text.

But in case you'll need to, you can contact me over my mail [douman@gmx.se](mailto:douman@gmx.se)
